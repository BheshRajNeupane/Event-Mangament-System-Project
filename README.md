# Event Management System

 # Overview
This project is a comprehensive Event Management System designed to enable users to create, manage, and explore events with ease. It employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform event-related actions. User data and event data are validated using a robust validator, and all errors are handled gracefully to provide a smooth user experience. The system supports operations such as creating, viewing, filtering, updating, and deleting events. All user and event data are securely stored in user.json and event.json files, respectively. Additionally, the project includes thorough unit testing to ensure the reliability and accuracy of all core functionalities.

- Note: Data is stored in JSON files rather than in databases; these  files are generated automatically upon user registration and event creation.

## Authentication

Authentication in the Event Management Project is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features, such as creating, updating, and deleting events. JWTs are used to securely transmit user session information between the client and server.

### Signup

To create a new account, users must provide a unique email and password.
The user then signs in by sending a POST request Endpoint and receives a JWT/cookie.
 - **Endpoint:**` POST http://127.0.0.1:3005/api/events/users/signup/`
- **Request Body:**
 ```
{
  "email": "your_email",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```
- **Response:**
 ```
{
    "id": Randomly genrated,
    "email": "your_email",
    "password": "your_hashed _password"
}
```
**Demo**
 ```
{
    "email":"manish11@gmail.com",
    "password":"1234567"
}
 ```

  ```
{
    "id": 8,
    "email": "manish11@gmail.com",
    "password": "2668cadb697f7e037920e287a7c59ae88c82006d1acc9c7d537ca6e4f5ac150c10df4b16b6bfe27c037312f63f72f7d3ef3d535570f1ae9d57ee84de832ace75.4f4c5c310e7d9b21bdbb87c72dc8724c"
} 
```


### Signin
Once registered, users can log into their account using their email and password. Upon successful login, a JWT is issued to the user.
The user then signs in by sending a POST request Endpoint and receives a JWT/cookie.

- **Endpoint:** ` POST http://127.0.0.1:3005/api/events/users/signin/`
Request Body:
 ```
{
  "email": "your_email",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```
- **Response:**
 ```
{
    "id": Randomly genrated,
    "email": "your_email",
    "password": "your_hashed _password"
}
```
  ### Signout:

- **Endpoint:** ` POST http://127.0.0.1:3005/api/events/users/signin/`

## Event operations
Authenticated users can only perform event operations such as create, read, filter, update, and delete.

Confirms that event details are correctly retrieved based on provided identifiers.

- **signinEvent.test.js:** Unit test for the user signin route.

Checks for appropriate error handling when incorrect credentials are provided.
- **signupEvent.test.js:** Unit test for the user signup route.

Ensures that new users can sign up with valid credentials.
Tests the system's response to duplicate or invalid signup attempts.
